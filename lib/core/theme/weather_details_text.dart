0-2: Low. No protection needed. You can safely stay outside using minimal sun protection.

3-7: Moderate to High. Protection needed. Seek shade during late morning through mid-afternoon. When outside, generously apply broad-spectrum SPF-15 or higher sunscreen on exposed skin, and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses.
